### Books Wrapped - Explore, understand, and grow with your reading tastes
- Abstract
  ```
  In an era where music streaming services like Spotify and YouTube Music offer personalized insights into users’ musical preferences, we
  introduce ’Books Wrapped,’ an innovative application that extends this concept to reading. ’Books Wrapped’ empowers users to gain a
  deeper understanding of their personalities through their reading choices. Our system comprises three integral components: the Abstract
  Web Scraper, which collects book abstracts from the internet; the Key Phrase Extractor, which identifies genres and significant words from
  these abstracts; and the Personality Trait Generator, which derives insights about users’ personalities based on these key phrases. Users
  simply input their reading catalog to receive a visually engaging tag cloud of keywords and an analysis of their personality traits, offering
  a unique perspective on how their reading choices reflect and shape their identity.
